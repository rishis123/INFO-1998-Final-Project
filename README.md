# INFO-1998-Final-Project
In this final project, me and fellow INFO 1998 student Ethan Huang aim to build a few machine learning models to determine the best predictive features of a diabetes risk-factors dataset from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey (through Kaggle).

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/ 

Models used -- Decision Tree (optimizing for best depth) with K-Fold cross validation along with Logistic Regression across features (standardizing 0 - non-diabetic vs. 2 - diabetic, shift from the given dataset of 1 - pre-diabetic (consider as non-diabetic)).

Visualizations used -- #TODO
